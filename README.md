##That means two weeks. These weeks are special, there will be cakes. 
The term fortnight first came about from the German castle _Insertrandomnamehere_ which was a fortress that was built entirely from the corpses of dead knight. However, human corpses make **very** bad building material, and the fort collapsed on its own after just two weeks. Now the name lives on as an insult to the hubris of the dead.
